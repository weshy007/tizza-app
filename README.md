# Tizza App
- Tizza is a mobile first application in which users can decide by photographs and descriptions of pizzas if they like them or not. 
- Upon liking a place, the user will receive notifications of group visits organized to the given pizza place using the application. 
- The end user has a friends list, which they should be able to manage. There can be settings for private(friends only) and public (not just friends) events by the user.
